ETSY Scraper

This project grabs projects from ETSY sellers. This project then figures out the 5 most significant words in the description.  The project then outputs an html file as a report template.


To install simply do the following in a bash prompt:
source ./install


Has been tested on ubuntu 18.09 with Python 3.6.8

Things I would do if i had more time:
Implement a logging layer.
Parallelize the fetching of Etsy API Calls.
Implement proxying with specifiable certificates.
